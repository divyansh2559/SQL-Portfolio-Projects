Project 1: COVID-19 Data Analysis and Insights Using SQL
<br>
1) Streamlined Covid-19 data: removed duplicates, standardized text, resolved errors, and formatted text.
2) Imported cleaned data into Microsoft SQL Server and extracted relevant information using SQL queries.
3) Analyzed total cases versus total deaths by states and compared total cases to population across different states.
4) Identified countries with the highest infection rates and those with the highest death counts using SQL queries.
5) Determined the highest death count by continents and explored the relationship between total population and vaccinations using SQL queries.
